# Static Web Server using ExpressJS

This repository was an introduction into creating JS web servers during my bootcamp at Code Nation.

## Installation and running this server

After cloning this repository, open a terminal in the root folder and run `npm install` to install the dependancies.

Once this is done you can run the server with the terminal command `node src/server.js`. Afterwards, open your web browser of choice and navigate to:

> http://localhost:5001

Note: You may wish to alter the port number based on the message that is logged to the terminal.
